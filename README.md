# S7Quiz
Submission for a quiz involving inheritance using Java. There are 3 classes in this project which are Person, Mahasiswa, and Dosen. The classes Mahasiswa and Dosen are subclasses of Person, meaning they inherit their superclass' attributes (name and date of birth). I created a menu to and the user needs to input their choice. The choices are:

  1. Create a new Person object
  2. Create a new Mahasiswa object
  3. Create a new Dosen object
  4. Exit program

Menu 1-3 will ask the user to input the new objects attributes that will be stored in it like so:

After inputting, it will show the attributes of the object.
After each object is created, user will be asked another input to run the methods within them. The method "sleep" in will print "Bro is sleeping". Method "helpingDosen()" will add 10 points to Mahasiswa class. The methods selfDev(), teach(), p2m(), research(), and otherWorks() will add 10, 5, 5, 20, and 5 points to a Dosen respectively
